  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>I was born in Vancouver, Washington but grew up in Battle Ground. I am 21 years old and am of Filipino descent. Attending a university is an accomplishment I did after graduating high school in 2018. I was unable to finish there and ended up dropping out of class. I have worked in 3 different jobs including fast food, retail, and customer service. For my whole life I have been linked to computer knowledge as my dad works with them. This led me to join coding school because I wanted to expand that knowledge and give me a path for my future. I'm hoping my time at Epicodus will help me get ready for that future.</p>

  <h4> Hobbies, Interests, and Skills</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Video games</li>
    <p>For as long as I can remember video games were always a huge hobby of mine and held interest throughout time. I currently game on my PC, however I tend to catch myself playing on my switch or my VR headset. My <em>favorite</em> games of all time:
      <ul>
        <li>Halo 3</li>

        <li>Super Smash Brothers</li>

        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <li>Basketball</li>
    <p>My safe space, the area i go to relieve stress and clear my mind has and will always be the basketball court. The love i have for sports brewed from basketball and specifically Dwyane Wade.</p>

    <li>Computers</li>
    <p>Like mentioned prior, I've always had computer knowledge that I could say is above the average person. My Aunts and Uncles would come to me for help on the computer whether troubleshooting or finding out how to work a program. The quick-learning aspect of me helps a lot, especially if it's something that I enjoy doing.</p>
